                  <h2>Introduction<a name="introduction"></a></h2>
                  <h3>What is NArrange?<a name="whatis"></a></h3>
                  <p>NArrange is a stand-alone, configurable .NET code beautification 
                    tool that automatically organizes code members and elements 
                    within .NET classes. It allows developers to easily sort class 
                    contents according to their style and layout conventions. 
                    NArrange works by parsing source code files into a document 
                    object model, arranging the elements then rewriting the arranged 
                    source code.</p>
                  <p>NArrange helps reduce the amount of time developers spend 
                    arranging members within source code files and when used a 
                    part of check-in procedures can also help reduce source code 
                    repository conflicts. With NArrange, developers don't need 
                    to worry about where they place a new member definition in 
                    a class, they can just type away and run NArrange prior to 
                    compilation. After formatting, the new member will be automatically 
                    moved to the appropriate location in the source file. NArrange 
                    is not only a great time saver, but it also helps enforce 
                    coding style standards across a team when a common configuration 
                    file is used.</p>
                  <h3>Supported Languages<a name="supportedlanguages"></a></h3>
                  <p>NArrange currently supports organization of C# and Visual 
                    Basic .NET source code files. Although NArrange has been built 
                    and tested under the .NET Framework 2.0 it includes support 
                    for many 3.0 and 3.5 language features such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Partial Methods</li>
                    <li>Extension Methods</li>
                    <li>Object Initializers</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Many 3.+ language features are exluded from this list, such 
                    as LINQ and Lambda Expressions. However, NArrange does not 
                    currently parse to the statement level of constructors, methods 
                    and properties, so these features are inherently supported.<br>
                    <br>
                    NArrange has been designed with the intention of supporting 
                    many .NET languages. If you are interested in implementing 
                    a parser/writer for an addional CLI language, please contact 
                    an NArrange contributor through the <a href="http|//sourceforge.net/projects/narrange/">SourceForge 
                    project site</a>. NArrange is still in the early stages of 
                    development so any suggestions to help make the framework 
                    more compatible with other languages would be greatly appreciated.</p>
                  <h3>Obtaining NArrange<a name="obtaining"></a></h3>

                  <h2>Using NArrange<a name="using"></a></h2>
                  <h3>Demo<a name="demo"></a></h3>
                  <p>To demonstrate the common usage scenarios of NArrange we'll 
                    start by creating a new project in our C# editor, in this 
                    case Visual Studio&reg;, and add a stub class with a constructor. 
                    Note that since NArrange is a stand-alone tool without any 
                    IDE dependencies, it can be used along with any code editor 
                    or within automated build processes.</p>
                  <p><img src="Images/Demo1Initial.png" width="800" height="600"><br>
                    <b>New Project with a Class Stub</b></p>
                  <p>With the project saved, NArrange can then be run against 
                    the source code file, project or solution. For running NArrange 
                    from the command line refer to <a href="#commandline">Command 
                    Line Usage</a> or to integrate with Visual Studio&reg; as 
                    an external tool see <a href="#vssetup">Microsoft&reg; Visual 
                    Studio&reg; Setup</a>. When running NArrange with an editor, 
                    it is recommended to backup or commit your source first or 
                    use the built-in <a href="#backup">backup feature</a>, which 
                    makes reverting formatting changes a snap. Either way, please 
                    be sure to protect your time investment in your code prior 
                    to running the tool.</p>

                    <b>Running NArrange as a VS External Tool</b></p>
                  <p>After running NArrange, the constructor we added to the stub 
                    class will automatically be enclosed in a #Constructors region 
                    (see image below).</p>
                  <p><img src="Images/Demo3OrganizedAnnotated.png" width="800" height="600"><br>
                    <b>After Running NArrange Against the Stub Class</b></p>
                  <p>Since our stub class doesn't yet have any functionality we'll 
                    then add a new method, called Demo, that writes a friendly 
                    message to the console. Note that when adding the new method 
                    we're not taking any care in regard to its placement within 
                    the class. In this case, we are adding it as the first member 
                    just inside the class body, before the constructor.</p>
                  <p><img src="Images/Demo4AddMember.png" width="800" height="600"> 
                    <br>
                    <b>Adding a New Member</b></p>
                  <p>After adding the new member we'll run NArrange again against 
                    the source file or project. The new method will be automatically 
                    moved to the proper location in the file and enclosed in an 
                    appropriate region (see below). The default configuration 
                    for NArrange also sorts members within groups or regions alphabetically 
                    by member name.</p>

                    <b>Rearranged Class with New Method</b></p>
                  <p>Scrolling up to the top of the source file, you will also 
                    notice that NArrange automatically enclosed the header comments 
                    in a region and applied grouping and sorting to using directives 
                    (see image below).</p>
