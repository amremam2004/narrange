The following changes were made in this release:

0.1.6.0
- Fixed parsing of C# generic delegates.
- Fixed parsing of the config file name in command line arguments.
- Allow closing comments to automatically be appended to members.  For example:
  public void MyMethod
  {
     ... Lots of code here
  } // End Method MyMethod  <-- Closing comment

- Fixed extra tabs being written after C# field declaration statements.
- Rough VB Parser implementation (not fully functional).
