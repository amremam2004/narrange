The following changes were made in this release:

0.1.9.0
- Fixed handling of C# fixed size buffer fields (i.e. "fixed" keyword).
- Parse attribute names and params to the code element model, vs. entire attribute text.
- Allow scoping in element attribute expression evaluation.  
  By default, place fields in types with StructLayout attributes in a "Fixed Fields"
  region and do not sort. 
- Improved parser handling of unhandled element text.
